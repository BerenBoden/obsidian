Electrons are negatively charged and protons are positively charged. Electrons are always moving, and protons are static. Electrons flow through a conductor, some materials are better at conducting electrons than others, a wet string, for example, will cause electrons to flow through it much better than a dry string, as there is less resistance in the dry string. 

### *Conventional current versus real current*
Conventional current assumes that electric current was the flow of positive charges to negative charges. Later experiments
