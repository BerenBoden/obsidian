To use MathJax in Obsidian for writing Schrödinger's equation, you'll need to enclose the equation in dollar signs to signal that you're writing in LaTeX, which MathJax interprets to display mathematical notation. For Schrödinger's equation, you can use either the time-dependent or time-independent form. Here's how to write both in Obsidian:

- **Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation**

    `$$\hat{H}\psi = E\psi$$`
    
    This denotes the time-independent form, where:
    
    - �^H^ is the Hamiltonian operator,
    - �ψ is the wave function,
    - �E is the energy of the system.
- **Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation**

    `$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x,t)$$`
    
    This denotes the time-dependent form, where:
    
    - �i is the imaginary unit,
    - ℏℏ is the reduced Planck's constant,
    - ∂∂�∂t∂​ represents the partial derivative with respect to time,
    - Ψ(�,�)Ψ(x,t) is the time-dependent wave function,
    - �^H^ is the Hamiltonian operator.

Make sure you're in edit mode in Obsidian when you insert these equations. Once you switch back to preview mode, Obsidian will render the LaTeX code using MathJax, displaying the equations beautifully formatted.
