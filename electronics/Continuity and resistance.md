  
Continuity testing and measuring resistance (ohms) are related concepts in electrical and electronics work, but they serve different purposes and provide different types of information.

### Continuity Testing

- **Purpose**: Continuity testing checks if there is a complete path for current to flow between two points. It's used to verify that electrical connections are secure and that there are no breaks in wires, circuits, or electrical components.
- **How It Works**: A continuity test sends a very small current through the circuit or component being tested. If the circuit is unbroken from one point to another, the multimeter typically emits a beep or shows a near-zero reading, indicating continuity.
- **Reading**: The specific reading isn't usually the focus; the primary interest is whether or not continuity exists (yes/no).

### Measuring Resistance (Ohms)

- **Purpose**: Measuring resistance determines the amount of opposition a material or device presents to the flow of electric current. It's used to assess the condition of components (like resistors) and circuits, ensuring they are within specified limits.
- **How It Works**: This measurement is more precise than a simple continuity check. The multimeter applies a voltage to the circuit and measures how much current flows, calculating the resistance using Ohm's Law.
- **Reading**: Provides a quantitative value in ohms (Ω), which can range from fractions of an ohm to several megaohms, depending on the resistance of the component or circuit.

### Key Differences

- **Continuity Test**: Essentially a binary test indicating whether a circuit is open or closed. It’s ideal for quick checks to ensure circuits are properly connected and there are no breaks.
- **Resistance Measurement**: Offers a specific value, giving insight into the condition and characteristics of the circuit or component. It can help diagnose issues like damaged components or improper wiring.
