**SUID (Set User ID) Bit**
- **On Files**: When a file with the SUID bit set is executed, the process runs with the permissions of the file's owner, not the user who initiated the execution. This is useful for binaries like `passwd`, which need to modify system files that are usually only accessible by the root user.
- **On Directories**: The SUID bit has no meaning when set on directories.

**SGID (Set Group ID) Bit**
- **On Files**: Similar to SUID, but the process will run with the permissions of the file's group owner.
- **On Directories**: Any file created within a directory that has the SGID bit set will inherit the directory's group ownership, rather than the creating user's primary group ownership.

**Sticky Bit**
- **On Files**: The Sticky Bit has no special meaning when set on files.
- **On Directories**: When set on a directory, the Sticky Bit prevents users from deleting or renaming files owned by other users. This is useful in shared directories like `/tmp`.

**Why can SUID bits be dangerous?**
SUID bits can be dangerous because they allow a user to execute a file with the permissions of the file's owner, which is often the root user. If a malicious or poorly coded file has the SUID bit set, it could perform unauthorized actions at the privilege level of the root user, compromising the system's security.

To search for SUID files on a system, you can use the `find` command as follows:

`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

This command searches the entire file system (`/`) for files (`-type f`) with the SUID bit set (`-perm -u=s`). The `2>/dev/null` part suppresses error messages, such as permission denied errors.

From the output I noticed an out of the ordinary file `/usr/bin/menu`. Now run a permissions check on the file with `ls -l /usr/bin/menu`, the permissions are `-rwsr-xr-x` which indicate that the SUID (Set User ID) bit is set. This means that anyone who runs this binary will execute it with the permissions of the file's owner, usually root in system directories like `/usr/bin/`

You can use the `strings` command against a file to see human readable strings from a binary file. I notice three strings that stand out from running the command `strings /usr/bin/menu`:
```
curl -I localhost
uname -r
ifconfig
```

The strings `curl -I localhost`, `uname -r`, and `ifconfig` are all system commands that:
- `curl -I localhost`: Fetches header information from the localhost web server. This could be used to gather information about the web server running on the machine.
- `uname -r`: Provides the kernel release details. This could be used for identifying potential vulnerabilities in the kernel.
- `ifconfig`: Provides network configuration information. This could be used to gather information about the network interfaces.

Now we know some information that will help us escalate privileges:
- The `/usr/bin/menu` binary has the SUID bit set, meaning it runs with the permissions of its owner, which is usually the root user.
- This binary calls other programs, such as `curl`.

- Navigate to the `/tmp` directory then create a malicious version of `curl` that is actually a shell `/bin/sh` with this command `echo /bin/sh > curl`. This will create a file named `curl` that contains the string `/bin/sh`.
- Add that file to the system's `PATH` variable with `export PATH=/tmp:$PATH` command, and then run `chmod 777 curl` to give it all permissions.
- Now when `/usr/bin/menu` is run, it looks for curl in the directory listed in `PATH` at `/tmp/curl` . It finds the malicious curl first and executes it. Since `usr/bin/menu` runs with root permissions, the malicious `curl` (which is actually `/bin/sh`) also runs with root permissions, giving the attacker root access.

/usr/bin/menu
