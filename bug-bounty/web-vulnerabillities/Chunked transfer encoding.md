Chunked transfer encoding is a data transfer mechanism in HTTP/1.1 that allows a server to maintain a persistent connection for dynamically generated content. Instead of sending data in a single, large block with a predefined size, chunked encoding allows data to be broken into a series of chunks. Each chunk is sent separately and is preceded by its size in bytes.

Here's how it works:
- The server sends the header `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` to indicate that the response will be sent in chunks.
- Each chunk starts with the length of the chunk data in hexadecimal format, followed by a CRLF (Carriage Return and Line Feed), then the actual data, and another CRLF.
- After all chunks have been sent, a zero-length chunk is sent to signify the end. This is followed by an optional footer and finally another CRLF.

Here's a simplified example:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/plain

7\r\n
Mozilla\r\n 
9\r\n
Developer\r\n
7\r\n
Network\r\n
0\r\n 
\r\n
```

In this example:
- The first chunk has a size of 7 bytes and carries the data "Mozilla".
- The second chunk has a size of 9 bytes and carries the data "Developer".
- The third chunk has a size of 7 bytes and carries the data "Network".
- A zero-length chunk indicates the end of the data.

Advantages of chunked encoding:
- **Dynamic Content**: It's useful for sending content that is dynamically generated and the total size is not known at the beginning.
- **Keep-Alive**: It allows for persistent connections, meaning the server can start sending data before knowing the total content length, keeping the connection open for potential subsequent requests.
- **Real-Time**: It can be used for real-time or streaming applications where data needs to be sent as soon as it is available.

Chunked transfer encoding is only available in HTTP/1.1 and is not in HTTP/1.0. In HTTP/2, data framing is fundamentally different, and chunked encoding is not needed.
