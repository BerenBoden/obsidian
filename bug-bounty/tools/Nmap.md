##### ***Commands***
**Run Nmap in verbose**
```
nmap <ip> -vvv
```

The `-vvv` flag in Nmap is used for verbose output. In Nmap, the level of verbosity controls the amount of detail shown in the scan output. A single `-v` provides a moderate amount of information, while adding additional `v` characters increases the level of verbosity.

In the case of `-vvv`, Nmap will display even more information about the ongoing scan than with `-vv` or `-v`. This can be useful for debugging or for getting a more comprehensive understanding of what the tool is doing during the scan.
