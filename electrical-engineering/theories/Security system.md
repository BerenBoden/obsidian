2 yellow cables into AC
Difference between chassis grounding and earth grounding?
### Keypad wiring
C- blue
C+ yellow
MEG black
POS red
- **C- (Blue)**: This usually represents the "Common Negative" or "Negative Control" connection. In security systems, "C-" might be used for the negative return path for a control signal, often part of the circuit for sensors or control panels.
    
- **C+ (Yellow)**: This is often used for the "Common Positive" or "Positive Control" connection. It could be the positive feed for control signals, indicating that this wire carries the positive voltage to sensors or control devices.
    
- **MEG (Black)**: In many security systems, black wires are used for ground connections, but in the context of "MEG," it could be specific to the system's design or a particular manufacturer's coding. Generally, black is associated with ground or "negative" in DC power contexts. Without a standard meaning for "MEG," it's crucial to consult the specific documentation for your security system for accurate information.
    
- **POS (Red)**: This typically stands for "Positive" and is used for the positive power supply line. Red wires are commonly used to indicate the positive voltage supply in both DC and low-voltage AC circuits, such as those found in security systems.
### Internal siren
Black and blue from the internal system connects to the black cable of the internal siren
Red and yellow from the internal system connects to the red cable of the internal siren
### PIR 
12volt minus - black cable
12volt plus - red cable
First tamper - blue cable
Second tamper - resistor (2200ohm) hooks into the first terminal of the relay
Second terminal of relay - yellow cable

What does the resistor do? why 2200 ohms?
### External siren
Tamper terminal - one black, one blue
(
one red cable will be tap spliced
Positive siren - Red cable
Positive strobe - Red cable
)
(
one yellow cable will be tap spliced
Negative siren - yellow cable
Negative strobe - yellow cable
