P = I x E
E = P / I
I = P / E

P = Watts
I = Current, measured in Amperes
E = Voltage

V = Voltage
I = Current
R = Resistance

Voltage = Current X Resistance
Current = Voltage / Resistance


What is the current flowing through a resistor of 4 ohms when a voltage of 12 volts is applied across it? 3amps

You're troubleshooting a home where the kitchen lights are dimming whenever the refrigerator kicks on. Knowing the following information:

- Circuit breaker: 15 Amps
- Refrigerator motor: 10 Amps
- Light bulbs: 60W each (8 total)

2. Will the circuit breaker trip with both the refrigerator and lights running?
