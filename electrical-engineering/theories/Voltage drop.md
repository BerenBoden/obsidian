### *Calculate voltage drop across series circuit*
- Add the total resistance of all resistors in series (Rt)
- Find the current using Ohm's law (I = E/Rt)



Hello, I am looking to purchase 65x fencing batons at 1.3m x 50mm x 40mm or similar dimensions with H4 treatment, and if possible with pointed ends. 4x rough sawn H4 treated 4.8m x 200mm x 25mm retaining timber. And also 3x H4 round poles 125mm x 2.4m

I live at 119 Bristol RD8, in Inglewood. Would I be able to also have these items delivered?

Thank you.

Kind regards, 
Beren
