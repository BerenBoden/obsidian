- step 1. Total parallel resistance (Rp)
    
    - 1 / Rp = (1/R2 + 1/R3)
    - 1 / Rp = (1/20 + 1/30)
- step 2. Total resistance (Rt) of the circuit
    
    - Rt = R1 + Rp
    - Rt calculation using the result from step 1
- step 3. Total current (It) using Ohm's law
    
    - It = V / Rt
    - It = 100 / Rt (from step 2)
- step 4. Current through R2 (I2)
    
    - I2 = It * (R3 / (R2 + R3))
    - I2 calculation using It from step 3

  

- Step 1: Total parallel resistance of R2 and R3
    
    - Rp = 12 Ω
- Step 2: Total resistance of the circuit
    
    - Rt = R1 + Rp = 8 Ω + 12 Ω = 20 Ω
- Step 3: Total current using Ohm’s law
    
    - It = V / Rt = 40 V / 20 Ω = 5 A
- Step 4: Current through R2
    
    - I2 = It * (R3 / (R2 + R3)) = 5 A * (30 Ω / (20 Ω + 30 Ω)) = 3 A

Find the total resistance of the circuit (Rt)
- Find the total resistance for the paralell resistors (Rp)
- (1/R2 + 1/R3)^-1 = Rp
- (1/20 + 1/30)^-1 = 12
- Add series to find the total resistance of the circuit
- R1 + Rp
- 12 + 4 = 20
- Rt = 12 Ohms

Find total current (It) using Rt
- It = V/R
- 100 / 20 = 8.3
- It = 8.3 A
- Find voltage drop for R1 V = I*R1
- 8.3 * 8 = 66.4 V
- Find voltage drop for Rp V = I*Rp
- 8.3 * 4 = 33.2 V

Find current through R2 in Rp
- Find the current using I = V/R2
- 33.2 / 20 = 1.66
- R2 = 1.66Amps
