Find the current of each parralell resistor by using ohms law: I = V / R
- I R2 = V / R2
- 100 / 20 = 5
- I1 = 5 Amps

- I R3 = V / R3
- 100 / 30 = 3.3
- I2 = 3.3 Amps

Kirchhoff’s current law for parallel circuits to find total current (It): 
It = I1 + I2
- 5 + 3.3 = 8.3
- It = 8.3 Amps

The circuit is in series

Find the total equivalent resistance of the parallel branch (Rp):

- Rp = 1 / (( 1 / R2) + (1 / R3))

- 1 / (( 1 / 20) + (1 / 30)) = 12

- Rp = 12 Ohms

Calculate the total resistance of the circuit (Rt) including R1 and Rp: 

- Rt = R1 + Rp  

- 8 + 12 

- Rt = 20 ohms  

Find the total current (It) using Ohm's law and the total resistance of the circuit:

- It = V / Rt

- 100 / 20

- It = 5 Amps

  

Calculate the individual current flowing through I_R2 in the parallel branch: 

- I_R2 = It * (R3 / (I_R2 + I_R3))

- 5 * (30 / (20 + 30)) = 3

  
Answer: I_R2 = 3 Amps

```
Find total equivalent resistance (Rt)

- Solve for parallel and combine into resistance parallel (Rp): (1/R2 + 1/R3)

- Rp = (1/20 + 1/30)^-1 = 4

- Solve for series R1 + Rp

- 8 + 4 = 12

- Rt = 12 Ohms

  

Find total current (It) using Rt

- It = V/R

- 100 / 12 = 8.3

- It = 8.3 A

- Find voltage drop for R1 V = I*R1

- 8.3 * 8 = 66.4 V

- Find voltage drop for Rp V = I*Rp

- 8.3 * 4 = 33.2 V

  

Find current through R3 in Rp

 - Find the current using I = V/R3

- 33.2 / 30 = 1.66

- R3 = 1.1 Amps

  

Answer: R3 = 1.1 Amps

Total resistance of the parallel branch (Rp):
- Rp = 1 / (( 1 / 20) + (1 / 30))
- 1 / (( 1 / 20) + (1 / 30)) = 12
- Rp = 12 Ohms
  
Calculate the total resistance of the circuit (Rt) including R1 and Rp: 
- Rt = R1 + Rp  
- 8 + 12 
- Rt = 20 ohms  
  
Find the current using Ohm's law:
- It = V / Rt
- 100 / 20
- It = 5 Amps
  
Calculate the individual currents flowing through R2 and R3 using Ohm's Law: 
- I_R2 = V / R2 I_R2
- 100 / 20 I_R2 = 5 A  
- I_R3 = V / R3 I_R3
- 100 / 30 I_R3 = 3.33 A  
  
Substitute the values of I, I_R2, and I_R3 into the equation I * R2 + I * R3 and verify if it equals the total current flowing: I * R2 + I * R3 = (5 * 20) + (5 * 30) = 100 + 150 = 250 A  
  
, I * R2 + I * R3 = total current flowing
