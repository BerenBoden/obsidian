1. Fused glass
2. Hard rubber
3. Air
4. Mica
5. PVC

- **Fused glass (Fused Quartz)**: With a resistivity of 7.50×10177.50×1017 Ωm, fused glass stands out as the best insulator among the options provided. Its extremely high resistivity makes it an excellent insulator, effectively preventing current flow.
    
- **Hard rubber**: Ranking as the second-best insulator with a resistivity of 1.00×10151.00×1015 Ωm, hard rubber significantly resists electrical current, making it highly effective for insulating purposes.
    
- **Air**: With a resistivity of 1.30×10141.30×1014 Ωm, air is an excellent insulator under normal conditions, serving effectively to insulate by preventing the flow of electric current through it.
    
- **Mica**: Mica's resistivity is 1.00×10131.00×1013 Ωm, making it a good electrical insulator. Its unique properties also allow it to be used in high-temperature and high-voltage applications.
    
- **PVC**: PVC, with a resistivity of 1.00×10121.00×1012 Ωm, offers good insulation properties and is widely used in electrical wiring and cables, although it has the lowest resistivity among the listed materials, making it the least effective insulator in this selection.
