- **First, determine the total hours used per year.**
    - The heater is used for 77 hours a day.
    - It is used 66 days a week.
    - It is used for 5050 weeks in a year.

Thus, the total hours used per year = 7 hours/day7hours/day ×6 days/week×6days/week ×50 weeks/year×50weeks/year = 21002100 hours/year.

- **Next, account for the fact that the heater is only using energy 75%75% of the time it is turned on.**
    
    - So, effective hours used per year = 2100 hours/year2100hours/year ×0.75×0.75 = 15751575 hours/year.
- **Finally, calculate the energy used in kilowatt-hours (kWh).**
    
    - The power rating of the heater is 20002000 W, or 22 kW (since 11 kW = 10001000 W).
    - Energy used in kWh = Power (in kW) ×× Effective hours used per year = 2 kW2kW ×1575 hours/year×1575hours/year = 31503150 kWh.

Therefore, the heater uses 31503150 kWh of electrical energy in one year.
