### *Question 1*
To transpose the formula $\displaystyle P = {2\pi NT}$ to solve for $\displaystyle {T}$, we need to isolate $\displaystyle {T}$ on one side of the equation.

Starting with:
$\displaystyle P = 2\pi NT$

To isolate T, you divide both sides by 2πN:
$\displaystyle T = \frac{P}{2\pi N}$

So, the formula transposed to solve for T is:
$\displaystyle T = \frac{P}{2\pi N}$

This shows the relationship between P, N, and T when solving for T.
### *Question 2*
1. For T=IQ​, making I the subject:

	Starting with the formula:
	$\displaystyle T = \frac{Q}{I}$
	
	To solve for I, multiply both sides by I and then divide by T to isolate I:
	$\displaystyle I = \frac{Q}{T}$

2. For =T=CR, making R the subject:

	Starting with the formula:
	$\displaystyle T = CR$
	
	To solve for R, divide both sides by C to isolate R:
	$\displaystyle R = \frac{T}{C}$
	
	These steps show how to transpose the original formulas to solve for I and R respectively.

### *Question 7*
To transpose the given formulas and make the specified variables the subjects, here's the step-by-step process along with the LaTeX expressions:

1. For =P=IV, making V the subject:

	Starting with the formula:
	$\displaystyle P = IV$
	To solve for V, you divide both sides by I to isolate V:
	$\displaystyle V = \frac{P}{I}$

2.  For =Q=IT, making I the subject:

	Starting with the formula:
	$\displaystyle Q = IT$
	To solve for I, you divide both sides by T to isolate I:
	$\displaystyle I = \frac{Q}{T}$

### *Question 12*
1453 x 0.15 = 217.95 
1453 + 217.95 = $1670.95



The original formula is:

P = I*V

  

V is being multiplied by I, I want V to be the subject, so divide I*V by I.

P = I*V / I
  
Both of the I will cancel each other out, now left with only V.

P / I = V  

  

Flip the equation around.
Answer: V = P / I
