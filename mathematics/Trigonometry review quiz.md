### *Question 1*
1. The opposite side (the side opposite to the angle) can be found using the tangent function, which is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side:

	$\displaystyle \tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\text{Adjacent}}$
	
	Using the angle (48 degrees) and the adjacent side (8 units), you get:
	
	$\displaystyle \tan(48^{\circ}) = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{8}$
	
	To find the opposite side, rearrange the equation:
	
	$\displaystyle \text{Opposite} = \tan(48^{\circ}) \times 8$
	$\displaystyle \text{Opposite} = 8.88$

2. To find the hypotenuse (the longest side of the right triangle), you can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (a and b):
   
    $\displaystyle {c^2}$=$\displaystyle {a^2}$+$\displaystyle {b^2}$
    $\displaystyle c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$
    $\displaystyle c = \sqrt{8^2 + (\tan(48^{\circ}) \times 8)^2}$
    $\displaystyle c = {11.96}$
### *Question 4*
The calculations for the unknown sides of the triangle using the given angle of 35 degrees and the opposite side of 10 units are as follows:

1. For the adjacent side (the side next to the angle):

	We use the tangent function, which relates the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right-angled triangle. The formula used is
	$\displaystyle \text{Adjacent} = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\tan(\theta)}$
	
	With the opposite side given as 10 units and the angle as 35 degrees, the adjacent side is calculated as
	$\displaystyle \text{Adjacent} = \frac{10}{\tan(35^{\circ})}$

2. For the hypotenuse (the longest side opposite the right angle):

	We use the sine function, which relates the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right-angled triangle. The formula used is
	
	$\displaystyle \text{Hypotenuse} = \frac{\text{Opposite}}{\sin(\theta)}$
	
	With the opposite side given as 10 units and the angle as 35 degrees, the hypotenuse is calculated as
	
	$\displaystyle \text{Hypotenuse} = \frac{10}{\sin(35^{\circ})}$
	
	After calculating, the results are approximately:
	
	- Adjacent side = 14.28 units
	- Hypotenuse = 17.43 units
	
	Thus, the correct options from the list provided are:
	
	- a. Adjacent = 14.28
	- e. Hypotenuse = 17.43
