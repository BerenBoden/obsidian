##### ***What is the /var/lib/postgresql/14/main directory?***
In a PostgreSQL installation on a Unix-based system like Linux, the `/var/lib/postgresql/14/main` directory serves as the data directory where PostgreSQL stores its data files, configuration files, and operational logs. Below is an explanation of some of the important files and subdirectories you'll find there:

- **`PG_VERSION`**: This file contains the PostgreSQL major version number of the cluster. It's used by PostgreSQL to ensure compatibility.
    
- **`pg_logical`**: This folder is related to logical decoding. It's used for logical replication and storing changes that get shipped to logical replicas.
    
- **`pg_snapshots`**: Stores information related to old disk file snapshots, often used in backup solutions.
    
- **`pg_twophase`**: Contains state files for two-phase commit transactions.
    
- **`postmaster.pid`**: Stores the PID (Process ID) of the running `postmaster` process.
    
- **`base`**: Contains subdirectories for each database in the PostgreSQL instance, where each directory holds the actual data files and indexes of a database.
    
- **`pg_multixact`**: Stores information related to multi-transaction status, used in concurrency control.
    
- **`pg_stat`**: Typically used for statistics. This folder is often symlinked to elsewhere.
    
- **`pg_wal`**: Contains the Write-Ahead Logs, which are crucial for database recovery.
    
- **`global`**: Contains cluster-wide tables, like the list of databases and the system catalogs that are shared across all databases.
    
- **`pg_notify`**: Holds asynchronous notifications.
    
- **`pg_stat_tmp`**: Holds temporary files for statistics collection.
    
- **`pg_xact`**: Contains transaction status information (commit, rollback).
    
- **`postgresql.auto.conf`**: This file contains settings that are set by the `ALTER SYSTEM` command. It's read in addition to `postgresql.conf`.
    
- **`pg_commit_ts`**: Holds commit timestamp data if this feature is enabled.
    
- **`pg_replslot`**: Contains replication slot data.
    
- **`pg_serial`**: Stores information for serializable transactions.
    
- **`pg_subtrans`**: Used to hold subtransaction information.
    
- **`pg_tblspc`**: Contains symbolic links to tablespaces directories.
    
- **`postmaster.opts`**: Contains the command line options the server was last started with.
    
- **`pg_dynshmem`**: Contains information about dynamic shared memory.

##### ***What should a Sysadmin be familiar with?***
- **Database Engines**: Understanding the types of databases, like relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite), NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra), and in-memory databases (Redis), is important for choosing the right storage solutions.
    
- **Installation and Configuration**: Knowing how to install, configure, and secure a database engine is essential for setting up and maintaining database services.
    
- **Backup and Recovery**: Grasping various backup methods, scheduling backups, and knowing how to restore data is crucial for data integrity and disaster recovery.
    
- **Database Queries**: Basic knowledge of SQL for querying databases can be invaluable for diagnosing issues, especially performance-related ones.
    
- **User Management**: Understanding how to create, manage, and delete database users, as well as set permissions and roles, is key to maintaining security.
    
- **Monitoring and Metrics**: Familiarity with tools and practices for monitoring database performance, usage, and other metrics will help in proactive issue detection.
    
- **Performance Tuning**: Knowledge of indexing, query optimization, and configuration settings that can speed up database performance.
    
- **High Availability and Scaling**: Implementing and managing database replication, clustering, and load balancing ensures that databases are highly available and can handle increased loads.
    
- **Security**: Knowledge of encryption, access control, firewalls, and other security measures to protect sensitive data.
    
- **Data Migration**: Understanding how to safely and efficiently move data between databases, or between different versions of a database.
    
- **Log Management**: Knowing how to access, interpret, and manage database logs aids in troubleshooting and auditing.
    
- **Software Integration**: Understanding how databases interact with other software like web servers, caching systems, and applications helps in holistic system management.
    
- **Updates and Patch Management**: Keeping the database engine and related software updated is important for performance and security.
    
- **Compliance**: Awareness of legal and organizational regulations surrounding data storage and processing, such as GDPR, HIPAA, etc.
##### ***Create new user in PostgreSQL***
To create a new user in PostgreSQL, which is often referred to as a "role", you can use the `CREATE ROLE` command within the `psql` command-line interface. Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Log in to PostgreSQL** First, you need to log into PostgreSQL through the `psql` terminal. You typically do this as the `postgres` user or another superuser role.
    `psql -U postgres`
2. **Create a New Role** Use the `CREATE ROLE` command followed by the role name to create a new user. Optionally, you can specify attributes like `LOGIN`, `PASSWORD`, and `CREATEDB`.
    `CREATE ROLE new_username WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'secure_password';`
3. **Grant Permissions** After creating the user, you might want to grant them permissions to a database.
    `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE database_name TO new_username;`
4. **Alter Role (Optional)** You may want to alter the role to add or change attributes.
    `ALTER ROLE new_username WITH CREATEDB;`
5. **Exit `psql`** Once you have completed creating the user and setting their permissions, you can exit the `psql` command-line interface.
    `\q`
**Example**:
Letâ€™s walk through an example where we create a new user named `example_user` with a password and the ability to create databases:
`CREATE ROLE example_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password_here' CREATEDB;`

Make sure to replace `'password_here'` with a strong password for your new user. It's also a good practice to assign only the necessary permissions that the user needs to accomplish their tasks, following the principle of least privilege.
##### ***PSQL Scripts***
**Delete all tables**
```sql
DO $$ 
DECLARE 
    table_name text; 
BEGIN 
    FOR table_name IN (SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public') 
    LOOP 
        EXECUTE 'DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ' || table_name || ' CASCADE'; 
    END LOOP; 
END $$;
DO
```

**Drop rows from table**
```
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**DELETE Command**: This command removes all rows from a table but does not reset the table's identity columns. It's slower than `TRUNCATE` because it logs individual row deletions.

```
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
```
**TRUNCATE Command**: This command is more efficient for completely removing all rows from a table, especially for large tables. It also resets identity columns.
