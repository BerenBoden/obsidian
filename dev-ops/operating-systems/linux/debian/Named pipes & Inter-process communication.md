Named Pipes: Named pipes allow for message-based communication between processes over the network. One process writes to the "pipe," and another process reads from it, even if these processes are on different machines. This enables secure and synchronized data sharing.

For example, a database server running on one machine could expose a named pipe. A client application on a different machine could then use SMB to communicate with this named pipe, sending SQL queries and receiving responses.

In this way, SMB serves as the underlying protocol that facilitates the transactional interaction between the two processes. The IPC occurs through the named pipe, but the communication over the network relies on SMB.

This ability to carry transaction protocols for IPC enables SMB to be much more than just a simple file-sharing protocol; it becomes a versatile tool for facilitating various types of network communications.
