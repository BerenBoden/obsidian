NVRAM stands for Non-Volatile Random-Access Memory. It's a type of memory that retains its stored data even when the power is turned off. In the context of networking devices like switches and routers, NVRAM is typically used to store configuration files and other settings. Because the data in NVRAM is preserved even after the device is powered off or rebooted, it's a reliable place to store configurations that should persist.
