### *Scenarios*
**Packet Tracer Scenarios for CCNA**
1. **Main ISP (Internet Service Provider)**:
	- Acts as the backbone of the entire network.
	- Provides internet connectivity to business and residential networks.
	- Utilizes high-capacity routers and switches.
	- Implements BGP for routing with external networks.
1. **VPN Provider**:
	- Offers VPN services for secure remote access.
	- VPN concentrators or routers configured for VPN (IPsec) for businesses and residential users.
	- Implement scenarios where users connect to the VPN for secure communication.
2. **Business Networks**:
	- Multiple business networks, each with its own internal LAN.
	- Use of routers and switches to create each business's internal network.
	- Implementation of VLANs for departmental segmentation.
	- Firewall configurations for security.
	- Connection to the ISP for internet access and to the VPN provider for secure remote access.
3. **Residential Networks**:
	- Simulate several residential networks with varying configurations (different ISPs, home routers, etc.).
	- Wi-Fi configurations for home users.
	- Basic firewall and security settings.
	- VPN client setup for secure remote work or privacy.
4. **Configuring VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing**:
    - Set up multiple VLANs in a business network and configure routing between them.
    - Include Layer 3 switches or router-on-a-stick configurations.
5. **Implementing a Basic OSPF Network**:
    - Use OSPF for internal routing within the ISP and business networks.
    - Create multiple areas and configure OSPF accordingly.
6. **Setting Up WAN Connections**:
    - Simulate leased line, MPLS, or other WAN connections between the ISP and business networks.
    - Configure and troubleshoot point-to-point connections.
7. **Configuring NAT and PAT**:
    - Implement NAT (Network Address Translation) for residential networks.
    - Use PAT (Port Address Translation) for accessing external services like web servers.
8. **VPN Configuration and Testing**:
    - Configure site-to-site and remote-access VPNs using IPsec.
    - Test VPN connectivity and security between business networks and VPN provider.
9. **Access Control and Security Policies**:
    - Implement access control lists (ACLs) on routers and firewalls.
    - Configure security policies and firewall rules for different scenarios.
10. **Troubleshooting Network Issues**:
    - Create scenarios with common network problems (misconfigurations, link failures) for troubleshooting practice.
11. **Quality of Service (QoS) Implementation**:
    - Configure QoS policies for prioritizing traffic like VoIP or streaming services in business networks.
12. **DHCP and DNS Configuration**:
    - Set up DHCP servers for dynamic IP allocation in residential and business networks.
    - Configure DNS settings for network resolution.
### *Need to know*
- Every port number and protocol
- Every acronym
- Cable lengths, types, distances, transceiver types, TIA/EIA terminations
- Sub netting off head
- WIFI standards, cellular, EAP
- Troubleshooting
- Commands and utilities
- Different stages of IP encapsulation and decapsulation
- MPLS
- GRE, mGRE, OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, Link state vs. distance vector vs. hybrid, administrative distances
- Policys (MTTR, MTBF, RTO, RPO)
- Provider links
- HEXADECIMAL conversion
- IPv6 address types, know extended unique identifier (EUI-64 conversion)
- DNS records
- There are many different MPLS elements, including the Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), Customer Edge (CE), Edge Label Switch Router (ELSR), Provider Edge (PE), Label Switch Router (LSR), and Provider (P) routers. The PE router is the MPLS provider’s router that connects to the customer.
- DHCP
- SAN connection type
- SNMP versions
- VPN headend & concentrator
- Performance metrics
- Active-active vs. active-passive - Multiple Internet service providers (ISPs)/diverse paths - Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)/First Hop Redundancy Protocol (FHRP)
- Separation of duties
- Network access control
- TACACS, RADIUS
- Difference between - Threat assessment - Vulnerability assessment - Penetration testing - Posture assessment
