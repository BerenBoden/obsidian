HSM? Hardware security module, is a device that generates and stores RSA keys in a way that is never exposed to the operating system. It can include mechanisms that erase the data if tampering is detected. 

TPM? A trusted platform provides full drive encryption.

Tunnel vs Transport mode IPSEC. Tunnel mode encrypts the full IP packet. While transport mode only encrypts the data payload. Tunnel mode is use for encrypting site-to-site connections. Transport mode is for host-to-host communications.

Embedded RTOS

risk register? A risk register lists risks and often includes the name of the risk, as well as the risk owner, mitigation measure and a risk score, and evaluates the supply chain. A risk matrix plots risks onto a graph or chart. A heat map plots risks onto a color coded chart. 

BIA?

Differential, incremental, full backups

SOAR, STIX, TAXII? Security Orchestratin Automation and Response 

A mandatory access control (MAC) scheme uses labels to control access

Oauth is for Authorization, not authentication

DAC - Discretionary access control

An SDN uses attribute based access control (ABAC), 

Integrity - hashing (you can compare the hash to determine if it has been modified)
Confidentiality - encryption (encrypt data between two )

Threat hunting is manually hunting for threats before an automated vulnerabillity scanner is used.
