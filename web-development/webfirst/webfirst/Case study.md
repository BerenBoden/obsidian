Webfirst is a web application development business that creates modern web applications with React and Next.js, as well as custom API integrations and applications for your business needs. I have built this website with Next.js using the new app router and Strapi headless CMS.

I have been working on this for about a year now, and this is the third iteration of the website, I finally decided to build it with Next.js and Strapi, because it is the easiest to setup for simple blogging + eCommerce applications and Next.js will improve SEO to get my website higher in Google search results. Webfirst does not just stop at Strapi and Next.js though, I can also implement custom API integrations with Node.js, and set up any database you need through either Amazon RDS, or a Railway instance, I prefer to set it up on Railway initially, until a website grows in traffic, because Amazon RDS will still charge, even if there are minuscule amounts of read or writes to the database.

Webfirst will make sure that your company ranks high in the Google search results, I haven't made the purchase yet, but I have tried out Semrush and Ahrefs for SEO research, I prefer Ahrefs, because it is a bit easier to use than Semrush and cheaper. I would also setup a Google business account, so that you will be seen when people are specifcally looking for businesses. 

Last iteration and live version of webfirst.co.nz:
